# APITesting
simple example of API testing using PostMan and Python

In this example we use the Federal Reserve API with no key http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/FRED/GDP.json to demonstrate the accessing of API data via both PostMan and Python.

We use Python to further manipulate the data:
1. We grab only the desired entry
2. We filter for entries that meet certain criteria (> $10,000).
